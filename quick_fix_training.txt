URGENT: Training is stuck at 50% for 3 hours!

Quick fixes to apply:

1. Reduce windows from 50 to 10:
   Line 1237 in ml_models.py: 
   Change: windows[:50]
   To: windows[:10]

2. Reduce epochs from 50 to 10:
   Line 1280 in ml_models.py:
   Change: epochs=50
   To: epochs=10

3. Or restart training with simpler settings:
   - Use 1-month horizon (not 6-month)
   - This will train only 1 model instead of 6

The issue: 
- 6 models × 50 epochs × 50 windows × backpropagation = VERY slow
- Estimated: 6 models × 50 epochs × 5 minutes = 25+ hours!

Solution: Reduce to 10 windows + 10 epochs = ~30 minutes total
